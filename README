Sets a random hostname from a wordfile at every shutdown
Created for and tested on Debian Sid

INSTALLATION:
# cp hostnamerand.sh /etc/init.d/
# chmod +x /etc/init.d/hostnamerand.sh
# update-rc.d hostnamerand.sh stop 01 0 6
Copy a wordlist to /usr/share/dict/hostnames

TODO:
* Make it more portable
* Check for malformed hostname
* Nicer insert into hosts file
* Better regex on wordlist (presently only removes apostrophes, based on my simple wordlist)
